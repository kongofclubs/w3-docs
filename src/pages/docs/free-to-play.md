RAYN is designed to simplify onboarding for new blockchain users. {% .lead %}

We intend to offer a free no-wallet version of the platform which will allow for the easiest entry for fiat users to learn about the blockchain. These users will then be incentivized to join the web3 ecosystem in order to receive rewards and interact with blockchain technologies.

By adopting successful web2 strategies and coupling them with web3 innovations, we intend to be a leader in the development of account abstraction (ERC4337) and secure onboarding software.
