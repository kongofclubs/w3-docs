We do not believe the market conditions were right for it and have seen a lot of fake pamps ruin projects early on.  

Most teams are looking for a big pay day and have lackluster follow-through, partially because of the pressure put on them by people involved in the presale. 

We want organic growth and to bring people in with the quality of our product as much as our community but we won't be a stranger to raiding.  We will also run heavy marketing campaigns when the time is right and we have established raiding parties in place.
