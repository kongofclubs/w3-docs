## Blockchain

Instead of storing data in one centralized location, blockchain technology distributes data to **nodes** across the globe to keep information decentralized.

People and companies that mine Bitcoin or stake Ethereum are called nodes. These nodes continually communicate with each other to ensure all data stored on the blockchain is valid and has not been tampered with in any way. 

## Does web3 mean decentralized?

No. A common mistake is thinking a system that communicates with decentralized technologies is itself decentralized, but this is rarely the case.

Although it is transparent and secure to keep certain information decentralized on chain - it can also create a very slow user experience without the coupling of some sort of centralized server for handling day-to-day performance tasks and interacting with basic users.

## What makes a fully decentralized application (dApp)?

If you want to view decentralized applications you will need to use either (1) a browser extension that allows viewing of dApps or (2) a special browser like Brave. 

Often these dApps will have uncommon domain extensions like ".dao" or ".nft".

If an application is using any kind of storage besides IPFS (decentralized peer-to-peer storage) then it would not be considered fully decentralized.
