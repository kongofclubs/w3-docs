***Web3 categorizes any system that interacts with blockchain technology.***

You can think of the blockchain as a vast automated metropolis. The "buildings" in this city are indestructible pieces of code called **smart contracts**.

In order to create trade within the city we need a package to store data which we can then ship between buildings. These "packages" are called **non-fungible tokens** (NFTs). 

All transfers of NFTs are visible on a widely distributed ledger to ensure accuracy and transparency. **Tokens come in two primary flavors:**

1. Standard digital asset tokens that may include media, like images, in the packaged data; commonly referred to as **NFTs**.
2. Payment tokens that represent value measured through the pooling of assets; commonly referred to as **cryptocurrencies**.

This means that all cryptocurrency tokens are NFTs, but not all NFTs are cryptocurrencies.
