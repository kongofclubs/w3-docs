Active players can earn money by participating in games and by selling accumulated game resources on secondary markets. These resources can also be used to improve a player's chances of winning prizes and increasing their daily earnings. The earned tokens can be sold or kept, and the commission from in-game purchased will be sent to the staking pool but is subject to change.

The game developers generate income by owning $RAYN tokens and through additional sources. Almost all game resources will be NFT tokens, which can be sold or purchased on popular NFT platforms. 

The long-term sustainability of the game economy will be supported by the development of new game modes, game resources, and the improvement of the rating system. 

The hosting of esports events with large prize pools will also boost the game's popularity.

The earn mechanics guarantee a high user retention rate, and the $RAYN tokens can be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges, attracting users from related crypto industries.

## Mobile Version

The release of a mobile version of the game will accelerate the game's growth and adoption of the new GameFi paradigm. 

## Paid Marketing

Paid user acquisition and marketing campaigns through partnerships, influencers, and organic engagement will further boost the game's popularity.
