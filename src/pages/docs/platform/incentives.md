The Rewardz® Network is designed to be a community-driven project, and thus our objective is to strike a sensible balance between the supply and demand of tokens, while optimizing incentives for all participants. 

**To achieve this, we will employ several methods:**

- Many games will be accessible for free, with most features and functions unlocked. However, users must purchase an NFT game item in order to be able to earn tokens in the game.
- Of each purchase, 10% will be allocated to the staking pool, while the other 90% will be designated for the prize pool. Subject to change based on market conditions.
- The P2E system, which enables active players to receive a reward in the form of liquid $RAYN tokens for winning tournaments.
- The NFT crafting system will allow players to combine items of equal strength to obtain a new NFT with a higher level. The $RAYN token will be used to facilitate this process.
- The in-game store will enable users to make purchases. Purchased resources will be owned directly by users, who have the right to resell them using available means. Additionally, 10% of every in-game store purchase will be allocated to the staking pool.
- There will be no transaction fees on tokens inside the dApp environment.
- The staking system and staking pool will enable users to lock $RAYN tokens for long-term storage while simultaneously accruing daily rewards.
- The DAO will feature a voting system and provide a means for making management decisions, turning active stakeholders into main decision-makers within the Rewardz® Network. The more tokens a user has locked in the staking platform, the greater their voting weight.
- NFT tokens will be issued both as part of collections and individually, which can be traded on major NFT platforms and provide strategic advantages in-game.

Additional features will be developed to expand the use case of tokens and internal game resources within the project and beyond.
