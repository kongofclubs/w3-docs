Decentralized Autonomous Organization {% .lead %}

As the project progresses and the distribution of $RAYN tokens is extended to all members of the community, it is expected that $RAYN will gradually evolve into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that will be overseen by the community.

Holders of $RAYN tokens who **meet a specific threshold of tokens** locked on the staking platform will have the opportunity to engage in community-driven voting on matters related to the project's ecosystem governance. The weight of a user's vote will be determined by the number of tokens they have locked.

**There is also a random mechanic that will give a soulbound NFT to a new group of people each month who gain access to project proposals without needing to be in the top token holders group.**

The matters presented for **voting** may include topics such as the allocation of funds from the prize and operations funds, changes in the total token supply, and other pertinent issues. The development team will implement the terms of all successfully passed motions in accordance with the voting results, subject to technological and commercial limitations.

At first most development projects will be directed at our **P2E ecosystem** in order to increase brand equity, rewards and token value.  *In the future this could change based on DAO voting.*

{% callout type="note" %}
During the initial stages, all decisions will be made unilaterally by the development team to steer the project in the appropriate direction.
