Rather than restricting revenue to a one-time transaction, we offer a comprehensive ongoing service that includes monetized content and additional paid features to enhance and augment the gaming ecosystem. 

## The P2E sources of income are as follows:

1. **Sales of in-game resources** such as weapons and upgrades via the in-game store. Users must purchase NFTs to play the game. Our team will frequently release new items to keep the games interesting and enhance user experience. Purchased resources will be issued in the form of NFT tokens, which will be fully owned by buyers.  
2. **Virtual Real Estate**  
3. **Release of limited edition NFT collections** periodically to improve the gaming experience and draw attention to the game. Each NFT token purchased from these collections will boost a user's chances of winning prizes. The funds raised will be used to finance operations, marketing, and increase staking rewards.  
4. **Ability to earn royalty payments** on secondary markets. We anticipate receiving additional revenue from reselling NFT resources and collections released by us on third-party platforms as the gaming economy expands.  
5. **Advertising and sponsorship** prospects. We will utilize a portion of our technology platform as a space for advertising, which will be seamlessly integrated into gameplay without causing disruptions. We aim to collaborate with numerous partner projects to execute this concept and help developers get their dApps seen. Mutually beneficial advertising agreements will help us acquire new users and generate additional revenue, which will be reinvested in the game.  
6. **Physical goods coupled with NFTs for digital merchandise.**  
7. **Competitions, Betting Pools and Tournaments**  
Organize large-scale gaming events with entry fees. The platform could take a percentage of the pot as revenue.  
8. **Lending and Borrowing**  
9. **Game Development Services**  
    1. **In-House Game Developers**  
    2. **Partnerships with Game Developers**  
10. **Premium Membership Services**
