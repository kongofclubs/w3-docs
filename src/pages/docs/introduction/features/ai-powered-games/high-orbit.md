Runtz {% .lead %}

Runtz: High Orbit is a tactical artillery game where small groups of PFP-outfitted characters battle each other across a variety of destructible maps with the goal of being the last group standing. Use weapons or interact with items on the map for buffs. This game will be play-to-earn with escrow wagers, built around the idea of promoting unity and trust between brands that we can use as a springboard for RAYN so we have an initial user base for the platform's P2E experiences.

## Crypto Gateway

RAYN has embarked on a mission to achieve a singular goal, which is to create an effective ambassador between the "real world" and the crypto space by means of a fun and accessible experience. Our project aims to compete in the web2 gaming market by creating two versions of the game, one of which is free-to-play and easily accessible via app stores such as Google Play and the Apple Store, and our play-to-earn version which will incorporate web3 technologies. By removing the barriers to entry that intimidate non-crypto users, our conversion strategy will employ the free version as both an incentive and an educational tool to inform the general public about crypto.

## Game Development

The design of the main game is crucial in achieving our mission. We have chosen the team-based battler for its depth of strategy and ease of expansion, which are key elements for retaining a long-term user-base. The setting of the emotionally stunted aliens with wild shapeshifting abilities was chosen to avoid being overlooked for being another generic entry within the gaming industry, as it provides flexibility and creativity while catering to industry trends. To address the challenge of converting users of the free-to-play version of Runtz: High Orbit, we rely on two premises (1) the importance of providing significant incentives and ease of entry to encourage users to enter the crypto space and (2) the fact that people generally respond better when they feel they have made their own decisions rather than being sold to.

## Education

We will implement various methods such as a visible lifetime tracker of how much the player could have earned if they had played the paid version of the game, in-game rewards for completing an educational mode, and details on the value of each NFT version of cards to show the value of the blockchain and its related functions. We will also create our own guides directly from the game to make the transition as easy and painless as possible.

## Expansion

As the game expands, we will assess opportunities to expand the IP, including avenues such as comics or an animated series.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, gamification is an effective educational tool that can be used to onboard new users into the crypto space. By combining blockchain play-to-earn functions with a high-quality game, high accessibility, and education - our project will create a perfect storm.
