## My Rewardz® Wallet

Your external wallet (Metamask, etc.) is the key to your Rewardz® Wallet. You can freely and easily swap between wallets while on the site.

Rewardz® Wallets act in every way like a normal personal wallet except for making transactions within our ecosystem **seamless** and **gasless**.

{% callout type="warning" %}
Only your personal wallet can unlock access to the smart wallet. If you lose access to your personal wallet, we will be unable to resolve that even if ordered by a court.

## Gasless Availability

There are many benefits to building on a layer-2 and one big one are cheaper transaction fees. For any fees that do need to be paid, we can employ the use of a paymaster. This will likely require holding some sort of NFT or staking a certain amount in order to have access.

### Paymaster

We currently use [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://www.openzeppelin.com/defender).  
This will be funded through transaction fees on the platform.
